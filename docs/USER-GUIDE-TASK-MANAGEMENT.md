## Troubleshooting

### "I can't start a task"

**Possible Reasons:**
- Task is not assigned to you → Claim it first with **Assign to Me**
- Task is already in progress by someone else
- Task is blocked → Check blocked reason and resolve

---

### "Task disappeared from my view"

**Possible Reasons:**
- You have filters enabled → Disable filters to see all tasks
- Task was completed by you → Enable **Completed** status filter to see it
- Task was reassigned to someone else
- Task was deleted by a manager

---

### "I can't find the task I'm looking for"

**Solution:**
1. Disable all filters (click each toggle off)
2. Enable **All Tasks** instead of **My Tasks**
3. Search by entity type (e.g., select "Service Ticket")
4. If still not found, contact your manager

A: No, only managers and administrators can reassign tasks. If you need to reassign, notify your manager.
