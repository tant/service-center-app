Archive documents when:
1. Superseded by newer versions
2. Implementation/project is complete
3. Content is purely historical (no active use)

## When NOT to Archive

Keep documents when:
1. Actively maintained (e.g., core shards 01-11)
2. Recent architectural changes (< 6 months)
3. Current system design (e.g., INVENTORY-WORKFLOW-V2.md)
4. Future planning (e.g., frontend-architecture-roadmap.md)
